"""Reward function for flight missions.

The score is a weighted combination of mission success and time efficiency::

    score = 0.50 * success_term + 0.50 * time_term

where

* ``success_term`` is ``1`` if the mission reaches its goal and ``0``
  otherwise.
* ``time_term`` is based on minimum theoretical time with 2% buffer.

Both weights sum to one. The final score is clamped to ``[0, 1]``.
