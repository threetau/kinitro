# Overview

Kinitro accelerates embodied intelligence by combining open competitions, verifiable evaluations, and on-chain incentives. Miners publish agents, validators coordinate secure rollouts, and the backend turns live results into network weights.

## Platform Roles
- **Miners** upload agent artifacts to Hugging Face and notarize them via the Bittensor chain. Use the [miner guide](./miner.md) to configure packaging, uploading, and on-chain commits.
- **Validators** maintain a websocket connection to the backend, persist jobs in pgqueuer, and relay results and episode logs. Follow the [validator guide](./validator.md) for environment setup and operations.
- **Evaluator operators** run the Ray orchestrator that spins up submission containers, executes benchmarks, and logs telemetry. See the [evaluator architecture notes](./architecture/evaluator.md) for details.
- **Backend operators** deploy the FastAPI service that monitors the chain, schedules jobs, and emits realtime updates. The [project README](../README.md) covers setup and runtime commands.

## Learn the Architecture
Start with the [architecture introduction](./architecture/introduction.md) for a system-level diagram and data flow. Then dive into specific components:
- [Orchestrator internals](./architecture/orchestrator.md)
- [Evaluator workers](./architecture/evaluator.md)
- [Incentive mechanism](./architecture/incentive.md)
